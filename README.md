A distributed streaming platform for Ruby built on top of Redis Streams.

Provides a multi-threaded publisher/subscriber.

## Project Status

This is alpha software and not suitable for production use.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Load balancing across named consumer groups
- [ ] Multi-threaded subscribers
- [ ] Configurable message serialization
- [ ] Automatic checkpoint storage
- [ ] Configurable retry logic

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jstreams'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jstreams

## Usage

### Publisher

```ruby
Jstreams.publish(
  stream: :users,
  message_type: :user_created,
  message: {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Mike Perham'
  }
)

Jstreams.publish(
  stream: :users,
  message_type: :user_logged_in,
  message: {
    id: 1
  }
)
```

### Subscriber

```ruby
Jstreams.subscribe(:user_activity_logger, :users) do |message, _stream|
  logger.info "User #{name}"
end

Jstreams.subscribe(:subscriber, ['foo:*', 'bar:*']) do |message, _stream|
  logger.info "User #{name}"
end
```

### Replay

Starts a temporary copy of the given subscriber until messages have been replayed up to the checkpoint stored at the time replay is called.

```ruby
Jstreams.replay(:user_activity_logger, from: message_id)
```

### Retries

By default subscribers will process messages indefinitely until successful. Retries

```ruby
# TODO
```

### Serialization

```ruby
class Serializer
  MESSAGE_TYPES = {
    user_created: UserCreatedMessage,
    user_logged_in: UserLoggedInMessage
  }

  def serialize(type, message)
    message_class(type).serialize(message)
  end

  def deserialize(type, message)
    message_class(type).deserialize(message)
  end

  private

  def message_class(type)
    MESSAGE_TYPES.fetch(type) do
      raise "Unknown message type: #{type}"
    end
  end
end

Jstreams.use_serializer(Serializer)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
